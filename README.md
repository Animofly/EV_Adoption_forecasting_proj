# ðŸ”® EV Adoption Forecasting â€“ Washington State Counties

This project forecasts the growth of Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption across counties in Washington State. Using time-series machine learning models and historical vehicle registration data, it enables users to interactively explore projected EV trends over the next 3 years.

### ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

- Uses monthly electric vehicle registration data by county from the Washington State Department of Licensing.
- Builds a regression model to predict future EV counts using lag, trend, and time-based features.
- Deploys an interactive Streamlit dashboard to visualize both monthly and cumulative EV growth.
- Users can explore forecasts by county and compare multiple counties side-by-side.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

- Understand time-series forecasting in the context of regional EV adoption.
- Engineer lag-based and rolling window features for temporal models.
- Tune machine learning models using cross-validation and optimization tools.
- Deploy an interactive dashboard for end-user analysis and insights.

## ðŸ“ˆ Methodology

1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**  
   Preprocessed county-level monthly EV registration data.

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   Added lag features, rolling averages, percent changes, and growth slopes.

3. **Model Selection & Training**  
   Random Forest Regressor selected for robustness with non-linear patterns.

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**  
   Optimized using Optuna for RÂ² performance.

5. **Evaluation**  
   TimeSeriesSplit cross-validation with RÂ², MAE, and RMSE metrics.

6. **Forecasting**  
   Forecasts generated monthly for 3 years using latest historical trends.

7. **Visualization**  
   Streamlit dashboard plots both monthly and cumulative EV forecasts.

## ðŸ“Š Results

- **MAE:** 0.01  
- **RMSE:** 0.06  
- **RÂ² Score:** 1.00  
- **Top Features:** Lag1 and Lag2 (combined ~65% importance)

> The model demonstrates excellent accuracy, consistency, and generalizability.

---

## ðŸš€ Streamlit Features

- Select any county to visualize 3-year EV trends.
- Toggle between **monthly** and **cumulative** forecast views.
- Compare EV growth for up to 3 counties simultaneously.
- Styled, responsive dashboard with light/dark adaptive color themes.

---

## ðŸ§  Future Scope

- Upgrade to deep learning models (e.g., LSTM, GRU, TFT).
- Integrate policy, pricing, and infrastructure data for richer context.
- Enable live updates by connecting to real-time EV datasets.
